# gcShiftManager

### Description
An application to provide open-source hours management to companies who don't have their own hours management system. 
Utilizing the Google Calendar API, and Dart, our aim is to build an application that will empower managers to be able to create schedules for their employees from anywhere and for employees to be able to see, post, or swap their hours as they can. 
Similar to what many retail chains employ around the world already, our goal is to make this publicly available so that any company, big or small, may use it in combination with their Google App Services.
